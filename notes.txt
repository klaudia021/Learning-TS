If we have lite server installed we can run "lite-server", se every time we re-transpile our file it will reload the page.

We can transpile our file with the --watch or -W, we go into watch mode. So every time we save our files they get recompiled.

We can add exclude at the end of the compilerOptions in the tsconfig, so we can exclude files from transpiling.
We can add node_modules
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
This is actually default, so we do not need to add exclude and node_modules (but if we add exclude we need to add node_modules).

Set transpile folder.
